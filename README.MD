# Fancy Music Player (Fmp)

A (very) simple and lightweight music player built on Electron.

The application features a pleasant dark-theme (for the night-owls) and an easy to use interface.

### The Best Part
The learning curve is almost **non-existant**.

### How to use
Simply start the application and drag-&-drop your desired music files in.

### How it works
This application uses the electron framework and takes advantage of the webaudio api. The javascript creates a new instance of the `Audio` class and let's it do all the work.

### RAM usage
When testing on a macbook air 2011, the memory usage capped out at 29 Megabytes.
